Usage:
Reading Quick is a tool that distills important ideas of a URL or text passage in seconds. With the simple click of a button, our engine produces the relevant language, key phrases, people, themes, emotions, and an overarching image for said URL or text. Our ultimate goal with this project was to help students and professionals everywhere study smarter, not harder using our free tool.

Technical Details:
The site was built using Django, a high-level Python Web framework and programmed using Python, HTML, and CSS. We utilized two APIs: IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding and Microsoft Azure Bing Image Search. Our web-based tool is deployed with Brandie's personal linux private server with Apache. In the creation of this site, we used Git to push and pull our contributions and sync progress. We now share the source code on Github for others and ourselves to view and grow from. Future developmental changes of the site will continue to be pulled from Git.
